Introduction: A healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor is transplanted into a patient with end-stage renal disease during a kidney transplant operation. (ESRD). The transplanted kidney replaces the failing kidneys, restoring normal renal function and preventing the need for dialysis for the patient. Over 200,000 kidney replacements are performed annually throughout the world, it is a proven therapy for ESRD. Over time, improvements in medical technology have improved kidney transplantation outcomes through the use of better immunosuppressive medications, better surgical methods, and a larger donor population. However, there are still difficulties with kidney transplantation, such as a lack of organ donors, the possibility of rejection, the negative effects of immunosuppressive medications, and the high expense of the procedure. Organ rejection can be identified using a variety of techniques, such as blood tests, biopsy, imaging tests, clinical symptoms, and treatment reaction monitoring. Numerous factors, such as low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders, can be influenced by the human gut microbiome on renal health. The relationship between the gut microbiome and the immune system is intricate and intertwined, with the gut microbiome helping to train and educate the immune system, controlling cytokine production, and stopping the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria, yeast, and other microorganisms. 
The composition and diversity of the gut microbiome are also influenced by the immune system, which also helps to control the activity and proliferation of harmful bacteria. The regulation of T cell differentiation and the modulation of immune responses are both influenced by the intestinal microbiota. It is essential to maintain a healthy and diverse gut flora to support the immune system's function and prevent the development of autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory conditions. Intestinal microbiota imbalances increase the chance of autoimmune diseases and low-grade systemic inflammation. These imbalances can be caused by antibiotic use, stress, and poor dietary choices. The presentation of antigens, the production of cytokines, metabolic cues, microbial products, and the emergence of immunological tolerance can all help to maintain immunological homeostasis. T-regs play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis, controlling autoimmune diseases, and preventing graft rejection. Intestinal bacteria that produce IL-10 include segmented filamentous bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium species, and Faecalibacterium species. (SFB).
Certain Clostridia species have been shown to change the percentage of Th17 and T regulatory cells and decrease IL-23 secretion in the gut. Solid organ donation may result in gut microbiota dysbiosis, also referred to as an imbalance in the composition of gut microbes brought on by factors such as immune-suppressive drugs, antibiotic use, dietary changes, and stress. (SOT). Negative impacts might include a higher possibility of developing metabolic diseases, a weakened intestinal barrier, and an elevated danger of infections.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha can be reduced by the helpful gut bacterium Bifidobacterium through a number of mechanisms, including modulation of the gut-liver axis, production of anti-inflammatory compounds, stimulation of regulatory T cells, and inhibition of NF-kB signalling. By re-establishing the function of the gut barrier and lowering gut inflammation, bifidobacterium can reduce gut leakage. It also causes the synthesis of regulatory T cells and anti-inflammatory substances like SCFAs. (Tregs). By removing harmful compounds and metabolic waste products from the bloodstream and regulating the immune reaction, the liver is essential in the control of systemic inflammation.
The production of metabolic liver enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, has been shown to be influenced by gut bacterial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids. While bile acids can control gene expression through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) pathway, SCFAs can modify gene expression and protein activity in the liver by activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These modifications in gene expression may affect metabolism and play a role in a number of metabolic disorders. Predicting drug-drug interactions and improving therapeutic results require an understanding of the interactions between gut bacterial metabolites and medications. For a variety of factors, including physiology, enzyme induction, concentration, and toxicity, the liver may prioritise the metabolism of gut bacterial metabolites over medications. 
Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive medication used to treat some autoimmune illnesses as well as to stop the rejection of transplanted organs. It functions by preventing the action of calcineurin, a particular protein that controls the activation of T-cells, an immune cell type involved in the body's defence against external invaders. The liver's CYP450 enzymes are used by microbes belonging to the Clostridiales order to change tacrolimus into a less potent metabolite. It's critical to comprehend the processes underlying this rivalry in order to foresee drug-drug interactions and improve therapeutic results. It is unclear exactly how the Clostridiales order changes tacrolimus into a less active metabolite, but it probably includes the CYP450 enzymes found in these bacteria and the unique environment of the gut.
Therefore, the effect of tacrolimus is studied on C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice [animal model] and a cohort of Human.
